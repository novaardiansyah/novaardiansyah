## Strategic Focus

Currently, my work revolves around two core pillars:
- **Mobile Development Mastery:** Forging high-performance mobile experiences using React Native and modern ecosystems.
- **AI-Agent Integration:** Developing autonomous agents and automating workflows with AI. My goal is to inject intelligence into every program I build for maximum optimization.
